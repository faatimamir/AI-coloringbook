- **AI-Powered Character:** Optionally upload a photo of your child, and the AI will create a coloring book character inspired by them!
- **Variety of Activities:** The generated book includes not just coloring pages, but also fun activities like mazes, connect-the-dots, and name tracing.
- **Customizable Cover:** Design a unique cover by choosing a template, font style, title color, and adding a personal dedication.

- **Theme-Based Creation:** Simply enter a theme like "Happy Avocados" or "Superhero Pets" to get a sheet of unique stickers.
- **AI-Generated Variety:** The AI first brainstorms a list of distinct sticker ideas based on your theme and then generates an image for each one.
- **Personal Touch:** Optionally include a photo to have the AI create stickers featuring a character that looks like your child.
- **Multiple Download Options:**
  - **PDF Sticker Sheet:** Get a ready-to-print PDF with all stickers arranged on a single page.
  - **ZIP Archive:** Download individual, high-resolution PNG files for each sticker.

###  Story Teller

- **Classic Tales, Reimagined:** Choose from a library of beloved fairy tales like Cinderella, Snow White, or The Three Little Pigs.
- **Personalized Characters:** Replace the original character names with names of your choice to make your child the star of the story.
- **Two Unique Modes:**
  - **Classic Mode (Fast):** The AI writes a personalized story and pairs it with beautiful, pre-generated illustrations for a classic storybook feel.

## How It Works: The Technology Stack

This application is built entirely on the frontend, leveraging powerful browser-based technologies and the Google Gemini API.

- **Frontend Framework:** **React** with **TypeScript** for a modern, type-safe, and component-based architecture.
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first UI development.
- **AI Engine:** **Google Gemini API** (`@google/genai`) is the core of the studio.
  - **Text Generation:** `gemini-2.5-flash` is used for all text-based tasks, including writing stories, generating sticker ideas, and powering the AI chatbot.
  - **Image Generation:** A robust, cascading system ensures high-quality images:
    - `imagen-4.0-generate-001` is the primary model for generating high-quality, artistic illustrations and coloring pages.
    - `gemini-2.5-flash-image` serves as a reliable fallback and is used for all image-to-image tasks (e.g., creating a character from a photo).
- **Client-Side File Generation:**
  - **jsPDF:** Used to dynamically create and format PDF files for coloring books, sticker sheets, and storybooks directly in the browser.
  - **JSZip:** Used to create `.zip` archives of individual sticker images for easy downloading.

##  Getting Started

This is a client-side application and can be run by simply opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Prerequisites

You must have a Google Gemini API key. This application is configured to access the key from an environment variable.

### Running the Application

1. **Set up your API Key:**
   - Ensure a `API_KEY` environment variable containing your Google Gemini API key is available in the execution environment where the application is served. The application will not function without it.

2. **Open the App:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. For the best experience, it's recommended to serve the files using a simple local server, but opening the file directly will also work.
